# Data & Structure
1. Use "0 Schema_Creation.sql" to create Schema.
2. Use "All_Data_Insertion_Sport_Product_Manufacturing.sql" to insert all the necessary data at once or use the .sql files from 1 to 9.11.

# Data Creation
This is my python program to create fake data:
"V3-Worker-and-Supplier.py"
"merged_adidas_nike.csv" is needed to run it.

These are earlier versions of my program and show my programming development:
"V1-Worker-Female-Male.py" and "V2-Supplier-and-Organization.py"
