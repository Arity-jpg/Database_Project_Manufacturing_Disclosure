# Introduction
Sport product manufacturers üè≠ disclose details about their factories as a part of their marketing strategy for transparency. With the implementation of this database system, you can effortlessly access and compare information of renowned sport product brands as Nike, Adidas, VF Corporation and Puma. üèÄ‚öΩüëü
This database system is designed to investigate and understand factory details across those brands, making their manufacturing more transparent. üìäüåê The data model intentionally abstracts away characteristics and relationships that are not crucial for problem solving. Ensuring an efficient representation of the real world of sport product manufacturing within the database design. üìäüíª

Mondial Database Update: Changes and Improvements
-
1. I began by creating entities based on the manufacturing disclosure table columns of Nike and Adidas. This involved adding some column titles as attributes for each entity and establishing connections between them.

2. Next, I added invented attributes for entities with fewer details like 'Supplier_Group' and 'Parent_Organization'. I also introduced an invented entity 'Worker' with its own invented data for one factory.

3. After this I created my first .sql Model Schema with Innovator, but I had to do some adjustments to the output.

4. To include manufacturing data from VF Corporation and Puma and make my model better, I had to make some changes. Specifically, I divided the initial 'Worker_Amount' into three new entities: 'Worker_Amount_Int', 'Worker_Amount_Percentage' and 'Worker_Amount_Range', so it could work well with the different kinds of data. Unfortunately while working on this part our Innovator license expired, but this didn't stop me from working on my project.

5. As I began to insert my data, I realized I needed to split the initial 'Address' entity into two parts, because I had no access to insert new data into the existing Mondial database. I encountered: "ERROR: in Tabelle ¬ªcity¬´, auf die verwiesen wird, gibt es keinen Unique-Constraint, der auf die angegebenen Schl√ºssel passt"
So I created an entity called 'Address_Mondial' with attributes like code, city, province, which were already in Mondial and had not NULL values for the composite key of city. Then I also made another entity called 'Address_Extended' that could only connect directly to Mondial by the code, because some data for country, province or city was NULL (not given by the brand) or did not exist in Mondial. I filtert the Addresses with logical statements in Excel to see where all three attributes for the composite key of city were given and matched with the Mondial data. I also had to adjust my Schema Creation, which was a bit more challenging, because the Innovator license was still expired at this time.

# Technical Work
Creating Data
-
I decided to add made-up information to my existing real-world data. I specifically chose Factory ID 55 of Nike and aimed to expand my model with a total of 28751 worker profiles. While there were online tools like https://cobbl.io/ that could generate data quickly, I decided to build my own tables in Python to enhance my technical skills.
To kickstart the process, I used code from the "Demo: Bulk Data Import in PostgreSQL" by thomas-schuster on GitHub and adjusted it to suit my needs. I crafted a table for each worker in Factory_ID 55, utilizing the Faker package to generate realistic attributes such as ID, first name, last name, gender, migrant status, line worker status, email, phonenumber and factory ID. The Pandas library came in handy for CSV manipulation.

Preparing Data
-
I organized my data based on the manufacturing disclosure table columns, merging information from four different sources/brands using Excel. Some basic adjustments were needed, like dealing with product type abbreviations such as ACC for Accessories, APP for Apparel, ... and so one in the Puma table. Excel functions like SVERWEIS() - which I learned in the office test - were useful for mapping IDs to each entity. Empty cells where replaced with "NULL" for data insertion.

For Nike I converted the worker data from the original file from percentage into numeric, so Nike and Adidas have numeric values, meanwhile VF Corporation and Puma have percentage values. I accomplished the number conversion of Nike in Excel by calculating the total worker amount with the percentage amount in decimal for line, migrant and female worker - male worker was computed. Because of the rounding in Excel the results for female and male were incremented by one, causing the total worker amount to have one worker too much. I solved this by comparing the summed up rounded results of female and male to the total worker amount with logical statements and fixed the rounded numbers by decrementing the male row by one - ensuring the correctness of the data.

Another adjustment was to extend the initial worker range column (example: 100-1000) from the original Puma and VF Corporation files into two columns: upper bound (1000) and lower bound (100) range. This was a necessary step to be able to query later.

Inserting Data
-
To create my SQL statements, I used https://tableconvert.com/, a tool introduced in our lecture. During the data insertion process, I encountered an error: "VALUES-Listen m√ºssen alle die gleiche L√§nge haben" (VALUES lists must all have the same length). Initially puzzled, I discovered that apostrophes in some names were causing unexpected issues. I resolved this by removing apostrophes from all data tables. Another issue related to spacing formats in Excel, particularly in factory names, was identified and resolved by inserting the data in "packages" of 10 - 100 rows until i found the line, which caused the problem.
Despite some challenges, including one mentioned in "Mondial Database Update: Changes and Improvements" point 5, I eventually succeeded in inserting my data.

# Conclusion & Outlook
Working on this project independently presented challenges, with a significant amount of time dedicated to data adjustments in Excel. Learning and implementing Faker and Pandas for data creation also consumed some time. While encountering manageable errors during data insertion, adjusting the model and Excel tables for the split address entity was somewhat tiring. The address entity, requiring logical statements for attribute checks, was a bit challenging. Nevertheless, the querying and writing routines part was in my opinion the most enjoyable. This gave me a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction after dealing with the data part for quite some time. üìäüíª

In summary, I'm satisfied with my Sport Product Manufacturing database üè≠üìä and the problem-solving skills I developed on the way. Looking ahead, I would add more data from different sport brands, acknowledging potential model changes. It would be interesting to learn more about the supply chain by finding out which countries provide the materials and getting real data about the suppliers. However, it's important to note that adding more details depends on whether brands share that information. Despite this, the current database offers a detailed view on sport product manufacturing, focusing on the factories. Meanwhile the connection to the Mondial Database gave additional insights into the manufacturing, which wouldn't have been possible without Mondial. üìäüåê
