## Project Overview
Our main goal (for all teams) will be to extend and update the mondial database used in our lecture. This idea was driven based on a arte documentation series called [Mit offenen Karten](https://www.arte.tv/de/videos/103960-020-A/mit-offenen-karten/) \(available in French and German\).

Your task is to choose a topic for extension and/or update of Mondial. You are free to choose any topic that makes sense. It is important that your topic can create a relationship to Mondial. Amongst others, you may use the following sources as basis to create ideas for extension/update:

1. [Our world in data](https://ourworldindata.org/)
2. [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)
3. [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page)
4. [Mit offenen Karten](https://www.arte.tv/de/videos/RC-014036/mit-offenen-karten/)

Once you selected a topic, you must contact your lecturer (via Moodle) to make sure you are on track (meaningful contribution, project sized properly, ...). Besides your topic, this repository provides a general solution template that you must use to submit your results. Literally: all your results have to be pushed to your (this) repository.


## Inspiration from Past Projects
If you're looking for some inspiration or ideas for your project topic, you might find it helpful to review some of the topics chosen by students in previous semesters. These topics can serve as a starting point or even spark a new idea for your own unique contribution to the Mondial database:

#### Notes
All topics are called Enz* because you must provide local data. Enz means Enzkreis and in this case also includes Pforzheim. Since we are not that strict, you may also add data of other municipalities close by (but not too far around).

For all topics you may find good data and ideas how to structure your database schema based on Wikipedia articles and also statistics and structures provided by Statistisches Landesamt. Regarding sport topics, think about women’s and men’s leagues and take a look at local league information (do not include professional sports such as Fußball Bundesliga).
